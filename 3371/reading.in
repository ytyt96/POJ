Flesch Reading Ease, a readability test named after its deviser Rudolf Flesch,
is among most ubiquitously used readability tests, which are principally
employed for assessment of the difficulty to understand a reading passage
written in English. The Flesch Reading Ease score of a passage relies solely
on three statistics, namely the total numbers of sentences, words and
syllables, of the passage.
